=============================

Crowd Pulse lemmatizer for the Italian language.

-----------------------------

The `lemmatizer-it` plugin needs two files in the class loader accessible resources directory:

- `morphit` contains a list of terms, lemmas and related POS tag (fetch it from the 
[official website](http://sslmitdev-online.sslmit.unibo.it/linguistics/morph-it.php)).
- `tanl-morphit` contains a mapping from TANL and MorphIT POS tags (included in this repo).
